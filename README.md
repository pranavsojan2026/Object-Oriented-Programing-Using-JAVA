# Java Swing String Reversal Application

This Java Swing application provides a simple user interface for reversing a string input by the user. It consists of two text fields where the user can input a string (`String1`) and view its reversed form (`String2`). Upon clicking the "Reverse" button, the application reverses the string entered in `String1` and displays the result in `String2` using a `StringBuilder` to efficiently reverse the string. Additionally, a "Clear" button is provided to clear both input fields.
